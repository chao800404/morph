/**
 * The selection round trip through the shell, rather than through the rules.
 *
 * `preview-reveal-request.test.ts` already pins what the editor decides about a
 * report — supersession, target matching, which preview it came from. What it
 * cannot see is whether the shell feeds those rules the right numbers, and that
 * is where this round trip has actually broken: a selection-mode re-assertion
 * that minted a fresh revision silently outranked the request the author had
 * just made, so the first tree click of every session was answered and then
 * thrown away.
 *
 * The harness plays the preview. `postEditorToPreviewMessage` is observed
 * instead of driven through a real iframe, because the transport refuses to
 * address a frame that is still same-origin — which is every iframe jsdom can
 * make — and would swallow the messages this is here to watch. Incoming
 * messages are real ones on `window`, so they still pass the transport's origin,
 * source and session checks.
 *
 * Not covered here: the reveal itself. Moving the canvas needs a viewport
 * height, and a stub that reports one makes the shell's own re-render path
 * interact with Radix's ref bookkeeping until React throws "Maximum update
 * depth exceeded" — intermittently, and only under a full run. A test that goes
 * red at random is not evidence, so it is left out rather than shipped flaky.
